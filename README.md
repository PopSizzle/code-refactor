# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

For this poject I refactored code for a website called "Horiseon". The code was already functional, so I was really going in to clean up the code and leave it in an simple and understandable state for the next developer who needed to work on it.

In general the goal was to keep the website displaying the same as it had been, but to make the code cleaner and overall more understandable and concise than its current

## Changes

For the most part the changes that I made to the existing code consisted of simplifying the .css file by combining duplicate instructions into one class. I also remade several classes as ids, given that they were only affecting one object. I added an id to the html file so that a linke would function properly. I wrote several comments to make it more clear to future developers what each section represented, and then I made the indentation and the spacing a little more friendly to read. Lastly, I cleaned up the instructions a little bit in the .css file and changed the minimum width of the body so that the menu items on the screen didn't collapse if the window was made smaller.

### Viewing/Editing

This site should function properly in any given internet browser, and can be opened and edited in any IDE which can edit .html and .css files. For viewing in the browser, see associated link. For editing the .html and .css files, see the link for the shared repository.
